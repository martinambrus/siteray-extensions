  Brave on Android

  Yes, Brave for Android does support Chrome extensions (it's one of the few mobile browsers
  that does). Since your extension uses MV3, it should work. Users can enable it via Brave's
  settings. However, the experience may vary - popup UI works differently on mobile, and
  content scripts may have quirks. Worth testing but not a guaranteed smooth experience.

  Native App with URL Selection Overlay

  Yes, this is absolutely feasible, and you're right that Google Translate uses exactly this
  pattern. Here's how it works on each platform:

  Android

  Two complementary mechanisms:

  1. PROCESS_TEXT Intent - This is how Google Translate appears in the text selection toolbar.
   You register an intent filter for android.intent.action.PROCESS_TEXT, and when a user
  selects text (including URLs) in any app, your app appears as an option in the floating
  toolbar. Your app receives the selected text, checks if it's a URL, and acts on it.
  2. Overlay / Floating Window (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission) - This is how you'd show the
  scan result as an overlay on top of the current app (like Messenger chat heads). Once the
  user taps your action in the selection menu, you display a floating view with the scan
  progress and result.

  So the flow would be: User selects URL -> taps "SiteRay" in selection menu -> floating
  overlay shows scan progress/result - all without leaving the current app.

  iOS

  iOS is more restrictive. There's no equivalent to PROCESS_TEXT. Your options:

  1. Share Extension - Appears in the system share sheet. User selects a URL, taps Share, taps
   SiteRay, and sees the result in a sheet. This is the most practical approach.
  2. Action Extension - Similar to share extension but can modify content in-place. Less
  relevant here.
  3. Safari Web Extension - iOS does support Safari extensions, so your existing web extension
   could be adapted for Safari on iOS. This would give the most seamless browser experience.

  iOS does not allow floating overlays on top of other apps - Apple prohibits this.

  Tech Stack Options

  For building both apps, you could use:
  - React Native or Expo - You already know React/Preact, so this is a natural fit. However,
  the native intent handling and overlay views require native modules.
  - Kotlin (Android) / Swift (iOS) - Separate native apps give you full control over the
  platform-specific features (PROCESS_TEXT, overlays, share extensions).
  - Flutter - Good cross-platform option with better native integration for overlays via
  platform channels.

  Given that the key features (text selection handling, overlays) are deeply
  platform-specific, you might get the best results with native apps or a cross-platform
  framework with native modules. The API calls to your SiteRay backend would be
  straightforward in any approach.

  Would you like to start building one of these? If so, which platform first, and do you have
  a preference on the tech stack?
